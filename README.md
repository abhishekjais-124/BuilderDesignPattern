# BuilderDesignPattern
LLD for Builder Design Pattern

This pattern is often used to simplify the construction of complex (or composite) objects with a step-by-step approach. An example can be thinking of a vehicle whose functionalities varies a lot depending on two wheeler or four wheeler vehicle.

Builder design pattern also helps in minimizing the number of parameters in the constructor and thus there is no need to pass in null for optional parameters to the constructor.
